# Alarm Clock Project

This is a simple alarm clock project implemented in Python. It allows users to set an alarm for a specific time and plays a sound when the alarm goes off.

## Features

- Set an alarm for a specific time using the 24-hour format.
- Display the current time.
- Play a sound when the alarm goes off.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


## Usage

1. When prompted, enter the desired alarm time in the format `HH:MM:SS`. For example, to set the alarm for 8:30:45 AM, enter `08:30:45`. Ensure that you use the 24-hour format.

2. The program will display the current time and wait for the alarm time to be reached.

3. Once the alarm time is reached, the program will play a sound to notify you.

4. You can stop the alarm by pressing `Ctrl + C` or closing the terminal window
